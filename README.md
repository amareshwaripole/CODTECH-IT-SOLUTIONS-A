Iris Flower Classification Project using Machine Learning
Machine learning is almost everywhere nowadays. It’s become more and more necessary day by day. From the recommendation of what to buy to recognizing a person, robotics, everywhere is machine learning. So in this project, we’ll create the “Hello World” of machine learning which means Iris flower classification.

Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.

Please download the source code of iris flower classification with opencv: Iris Flower Classification Project Code

Steps to Classify Iris Flower:
1. Load the data
2. Analyze and visualize the dataset
3. Model training.
4. Model Evaluation.
5. Testing the model.

Output:

Prediction of Species: [‘Iris-setosa’ ‘Iris-versicolor’ ‘Iris-virginica’]

It looks like the model is predicting correctly because the setosa is shortest and virginica is the longest and versicolor is in between these two.

We can save the model using pickle format.
And again we can load the model in any other program using pickle and use it using model.predict to predict the iris data.
Summary:
In this project, we learned to train our own supervised machine learning model using Iris Flower Classification Project with Machine Learning. Through this project, we learned about machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, model creation, etc.
